#### Learning Objectives:

1. Explain when you need to create a "connector table" to represent application data
2. Give examples of data that should be modelled using "One-to-Many" and "Many-to-Many" approaches
3. Build a Many-to-Many database and insert data, maintaining proper linkage and following "normal form"
4. Create syntactically correct SQL to JOIN through a connector table in a Many-to-Many situation
5. Illustrate a situation when One-to-Many cannot be used to model application data
